# Granger-Causality---Thesis
Repository for my master thesis "Granger Causality Analysis of the Interconnections between Equity Market and Cryptocurrencies"

Abstract:

The advent of cryptocurrencies has significantly reshaped the financial landscape by offering decentralized alternatives to traditional currencies. Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, started a wave of innovation, leading to the creation of numerous other digital assets.
During the past decade, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has increased, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking diversification and high returns. As of 2024, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies exceeds $2 trillion, analyzing their growing influence in financial markets.
This thesis investigates the causal relationships and dynamic interactions between equity markets and cryptocurrencies using advanced econometric models. Specifically, it examines whether there is a bidirectional causal relationship between major equity market indices and leading cryptocurrencies. The analysis employs Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models to capture linear interdependencies among multiple time series and Granger causality tests to explore predictive relationships.
The dataset includes daily closing prices for key equity indices alongside major cryptocurrencies, spanning from January 2019 to April 2024. The empirical findings from this research offer valuable insights into the interactions between equity markets and cryptocurrencies.
By identifying potential bidirectional causality and the transmission of shocks between these markets, this study increases our understanding of how emerging digital assets integrate with traditional financial systems.
Our findings indicate that the bidirectional causality between cryptocurrencies and equity indices, estimated using a rolling-window of three months, is stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic when financial markets were more volatile. This period revealed intensified interactions, with market shocks in one asset class more likely to influence the other. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly influenced major equity indices throughout the five-year period. Bitcoin and Ethereum, known for its role in decentralized finance, both displayed strong correlations with traditional market indices. Conversely, the Nikkei 225, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 emerged as the most influential indices affecting cryptocurrency prices. The NASDAQ, a hub for technology, aligns naturally with the tech-driven nature of cryptocurrencies, while the Russell 2000, representing smaller, volatile companies, mirrors the high-risk profile of many digital assets. This thesis aims to investigate the mechanisms through which equity markets and cryptocurrencies influence each other, shedding light on the broader implications of cryptocurrency
integration into the global financial system.
